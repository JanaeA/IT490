Summary: The point of this document is to give instructions on how to make a systemd script to run the database
server and DMZ server files so that it can be managed by systemd. The instructions are relatively the same for 
both of the servers.

Step 1: Go to /etc/systemd/system

Step 2: Make the DBService, you can call it DBServer.service. Do this by
typing sudo vim DBServer.service

Step 3: Inside the DBServer.service file type this in: 

[Unit]
Description=Run DBServer at startup after network becomes reachable

[Service]
Type=simple
RemainAfterExit=yes
ExecStart=/usr/bin/php -f /home/janae/git/IT490/DBServer.php
TimeoutStartSec=0

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target

Step 4: Then type systemctl daemon-reload

Step 5: Then type systemctl enable DBServer.service

You can type systemctl status DBServer.service to see the status of the service

The instructions are similar for the DMZServer, just change DBServer to DMZServer and do the same thing.
